<p>Hey all. I was attempting to make a webapp that linked TMDB API so that I may search for movies and then display it within my webapp. 

 I felt like I got the basic functionality of the webapp itself working right with some error checking for the input but I was unable to get the API to link.
 I went to the site and created an account to generate my API key and followed the documentation and examples that I found but I was unsuccessful. 
 I feel that I was on the right track but was probably missing some key steps here or there which is what caused it to not work. 
 Due to time constraints I didn't really have time to add any additonal CSS other than what the base build gives you. I was focusing more on the functionality and trying to get the API work.  </p>
